# Image-Classification-By-Deep-Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify images into predefined categories using deep learning techniques. The model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for high accuracy image classification.

## Analysis Tasks
1. **Data Preprocessing and Augmentation**
   - Prepare the data for training by normalizing and augmenting images.

2. **Model Architecture**
   - Design and implement a CNN architecture suitable for the dataset.

3. **Model Training**
   - Train the model using the training dataset and validate its performance on the validation dataset.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy and loss.

5. **Prediction**
   - Use the trained model to classify new images.
